This is linked list,a 3 sided market place where students will see the recuiters requirement for interns and they will maintain a profile 
after applying for intern it is recuiter duty to select or not.
 colleges will  have profile and show the best students and some stats about the college to attract recruiters.
 similarly recruiters have some cutoff of college rank(e.g like nirf).
